# Digital Petty Cash Ledger System

##  Introduction
The Digital Petty Cash Ledger System is a console-based C# application designed to manage small daily business expenses and petty cash replenishments.  
The system demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, generics, and type-safe in-memory data handling without using any external database.
